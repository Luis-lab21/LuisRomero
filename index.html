            <h3>Computer and Tech</h3>
            <p>From the age of 12 I was always facinated with tech and computers. Later in school I was exposed to coding in thing like C++, basic webdesign, and even some fundementals in hardware.  That interest led me to jobs which taught me new skills. From using GIS for the USDA to using photoshop to prepare buttterfly photos for ASU Insect colleciton, its a hoby that I have found usfeful in anywhere life takes me This website is also a result of my love of learning tech and I stull have many more projects I do in my fretime.

            <h3>Landscaping and Outdoors</h3>
            <p>One place that always brings me peace is a good mountain. During my undergraduate I quickly learned I loved being outdoors. This lead me to working a sruvey job with the USDA and later a postaion as a crew lead for AZ Conservatipn Corps. My desire for becoming an archetech lead me to opertuntiees to work more in landscaping deisgn and construciton</p>

            <h3>Gardening and Labratory</h3>
            <p>Exploring my grandfather’s apple orchard as a kid isntlled in me a love of nature and plants. Later in life I was fortunate enough to manage the Mycology Project at Chandler Gilbert Community college. Since that was part of the Enviromental Technology Center gave me the operuntiy to help mainatin and manage the garden. Ever since ive tired to grow every season along with growing mushrooms </p>
